		The project is complete, all the constrains in the several brances are working. The only thing that is not working is that in the branch AS and US when Clients issue sell orders for their own buy orders and vice versa, it only switches the type of the order. In the branch EU Clients are not allowed to issue sell orders for their own buy orders and vice versa and that constraint is working fine.
